4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Multiline Comment)
      Approach: I firstly start by drawing out the diagram and then work on the coding. I knew how I was going to change
      how scanner looks like for '/', so I added a case for '*' coming as the nextch. It was simple as reading a slash followed
      by the a star, then continuing until the star was found then only stopped to read the comment.

      Issues and resolution:
      I didnot have any issue with this part, it was straight and easy.

   Problem 2 (Operators)
      Approach:  This was similar to what i did on the project1, I added all the listed out operators on the tokeninfo
      once i got done with adding it all up I went to scanner and added the cases to the scanner file.

      Issues and resolution:
      I didnot have any issue with this part too as i was already aware how it was done looking at project1.
   
   Problem 3 (Reserved Words)
      Approach: This was simple operation too , I added the reserved word to the tokeninfo, and added them to hastable in
      the scanner at the top of the scanner file called scanner.java.

      Issues and resolution:
        I had few typo while working with it but with few test and running I was able to solve it.

   Problem 4 (Literals)
      Approach:  I first read the appendix for the homework assignment. I got the idea of how the double and the longs were
      defined. I then figured out to do the support for the double. I broke the problem into the sub problem and started to work on the
      project.I looked at the programming assignment grammar and realized that it gave the
      defination for the literal. I went to where digits are scanned and added if statements to check if they
      end with 'l'  or 'L' if it didnpt i appened that to the string and returned the long literal.

        similarly for double literal I checked for '.' in string of digits. I kept looking at the nextch intil I encounter
        a newline, EOFCH, ,operators,characters,whitespace. I added the clause in the '.' where it will check for the digits and if it does
        i ran a while loop with the cases above and then returned double literal with appended String.

      Issues and resolution:
         I had the problem while i was reading one to many charaters after reading the double whiche made my program loose the next line of the code
         after i checked the tokenized version with correct code i was able to fix the issue.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

I think this assignment gave a clear concept why we don't want to hand write the scanner. This project was
much more easier as we had already known what needed to be done. It was helpul to modify more onto the project which we have already done
as we were working on some files from earlier project it was comparitivly easy.
